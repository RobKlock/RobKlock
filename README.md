🔭 I’m working in industry and academia; the former on the backend at Arist and the latter on machine learning research. My research area of interest is the intersection between machine learning and neuroscience, specifically in probabilistic machine learning. 

⚡ Fun fact: I wanted to go to art school for oil painting and I now dabble in patternmaking.
