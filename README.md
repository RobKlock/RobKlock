ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working in industry and academia, the former on the backend at Arist and the latter on machine learning research. My primary areas are the intersections between machine learning and security/HCI and neuroscience. 

âš¡ Fun fact: I wanted to go to art school for oil painting and I now dabble in patternmaking. 
Note: From June until September 2020 I was working in Gitlab on a seperate account
